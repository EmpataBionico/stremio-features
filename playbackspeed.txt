Hi there, I love stremio, this is more a feature request than an issue,
i would like to have a keyboard shortcut to change the playbackspeed,
and also a general setting to set the general speed,
when i am watching anime, sometimes the scenes are too slow for me,
so i rather watch anime series in 2x,
specially the really long ones like "one piece".
thank you so much for your time and effort, like i said i love it.
